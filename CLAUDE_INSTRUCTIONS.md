# Claude Cowork Instructions — Dead in the Region Podcast Production

These instructions tell a Claude Cowork session how to use the files in this repository to generate podcast episodes in Speechify Studio.

**IMPORTANT — Workflow Change:** Episodes are now generated using a two-step process:
1. **Claude writes a narrative script** (using the `ditr-scriptwriter` skill) from the episode CSV data
2. **The script gets pasted into Speechify Studio** alongside speaker profiles and audience data

This replaces the old workflow where raw production prompts were pasted directly into Speechify. The script approach produces narrative-forward episodes rather than news-report-style output.

## What Each File Contains

### `data/episodes.csv`
The master episode guide with 21 columns per episode. Source of truth for all episode metadata.

### `data/speakers.json`
Three speaker profiles (Nate Alderman, Carmen Reyes, Dr. Mara Vasquez). Each has:
- `name` — paste into Speechify's Name field
- `biography` — paste into Speechify's Biography field
- `voice_style` — paste into Speechify's Voice Style field
- `type` — "host" or "guest"
- `episodes` — which episodes this speaker appears in

### `data/audience.json`
Five audience/mood text blocks (same for every episode):
- `primary_audience` → Speechify Step 2, "Primary Audience"
- `geography_background` → Speechify Step 2, "Geography & Background"
- `values_interests` → Speechify Step 2, "Values & Interests"
- `mood` → Speechify Step 2, "Mood"
- `tone` → Speechify Step 2, "Tone"

### `scripts/ep##-title.md` (NEW — Primary Workflow)
Narrative dialogue scripts generated by the `ditr-scriptwriter` skill. These are what get pasted
into Speechify's "Text Idea" field. Each script is a chronological, dialogue-driven story with
speaker labels (NATE:, CARMEN:), tonal shifts, and the full narrative arc.

### `prompts/ep##-title.md` (Legacy — Kept for Reference)
Production-notes-format prompts with section headers (THE CASE, HORROR BEATS, etc.). These were
the original approach but tend to produce news-report-style output in Speechify. Kept as reference
for the episode metadata, but scripts/ is the primary workflow now.

### `ditr-scriptwriter/` (Claude Skill)
The skill that generates scripts from CSV data. Read `ditr-scriptwriter/SKILL.md` for full
instructions. The skill reads episodes.csv, speakers.json, and audience.json to produce
narrative scripts.

## How to Generate a Podcast Episode

### Prerequisites
- Speechify Studio tab open (https://studio.speechify.com)
- Access to this repository
- The `ditr-scriptwriter` skill installed (or read it manually)

### Step 0: Generate the Script

**If using Claude Cowork with the skill installed:**
Say "Write a script for Episode [N]" and the skill will handle everything.

**If generating manually:**
1. Read `ditr-scriptwriter/SKILL.md` for the full workflow
2. Read `ditr-scriptwriter/references/script-structure.md` for act structure
3. Read the episode's row from `data/episodes.csv`
4. Read `data/speakers.json` and `data/audience.json` for voice/tone reference
5. Write the script following the skill's guidelines
6. Save to `scripts/ep##-title.md`

### Step 1: Create the Podcast in Speechify

1. Navigate to Speechify Studio → Library
2. Click **"Create a Podcast (Beta)"**
3. In the Pre-Creation Dialog:
   - Select the **"Text Idea"** tab
   - Paste the ENTIRE script from `scripts/ep##-title.md`
   - Set **Language** to "English (US)"
   - Set **Number of Speakers** to 2 (or 3 if Dr. Vasquez appears)
   - Set **Duration** to "20-30min"
4. Click **"Create"**

### Step 2: Review Source Content (Speechify Step 1)

Speechify generates a research document from the script. Because the script is narrative-forward
(not production notes), Speechify should produce something that reads like a story outline.

Review checklist:
- Does the cold open hook appear early?
- Is the narrative arc visible (setup → case → turn → outro)?
- Are host dynamics and tonal shifts reflected?
- Does it read as a story, not a report?

If it drifted toward report mode, use chat refinement:
"This should read as a narrative story told between two friends, not a news report.
Focus on the conversational dynamic and emotional arc."

### Step 3: Set Audience & Mood (Speechify Step 2)

**Replace all fields** with templates from `data/audience.json`:

| Speechify Field | Source |
|---|---|
| Primary Audience | `audience.json` → `primary_audience` |
| Geography & Background | `audience.json` → `geography_background` |
| Values & Interests | `audience.json` → `values_interests` |
| Mood | `audience.json` → `mood` |
| Tone | `audience.json` → `tone` |

**Episode-specific overrides:**
- Episode 8 (Tape 7): Adjust Mood to emphasize found-footage atmosphere, remove humor references
- Episode 11 (Meridian Line Pt 3): Adjust Mood to emphasize building dread and emotional intensity
- Episode 12 (Signal and Noise): Adjust Tone to note warmer, more reflective register

### Step 4: Set Speaker Profiles (Speechify Step 3)

**Replace all fields** with profiles from `data/speakers.json`:

**2-speaker episodes (standard):**
- Speaker 1 (Host): Nate Alderman (name, biography, voice_style)
- Speaker 2 (Guest): Carmen Reyes (name, biography, voice_style)

**3-speaker episodes (Eps 6, 8, 10, 12):**
- Add Speaker 3 (Guest 2): Dr. Mara Vasquez (name, biography, voice_style)

### Step 5: Review Script (Speechify Step 4)

Speechify generates full dialogue from the script. Review:
- [ ] Cold open hooks immediately
- [ ] Host voices are distinct (Nate measured, Carmen energetic)
- [ ] Comedy/horror balance follows the tonal arc
- [ ] The feel is "story" not "report"
- [ ] Foundry/serialization elements present where expected
- [ ] Episode ends with tease or cliffhanger

### Step 6: Audio Generation & Export

Generate audio. When complete:
- Spot-check: cold open, mid-episode section, outro
- Verify host voices sound distinct
- Check tonal shifts land audibly
- Export (.wav)

## Episode Production Order

## Notes for Claude Cowork Browser Automation

When automating Speechify via Claude Cowork's browser tools:

1. **Reading files:** All data files are JSON, CSV, or Markdown — easy to parse.
2. **Pasting into Speechify:** Click into textarea → Select all (Ctrl+A) → Paste (Ctrl+V). Wait for auto-save between fields.
3. **Navigation:** "Next step" buttons move through the wizard sequentially.
4. **Field detection:** Use accessibility tree or `find` tool to locate fields by label.
5. **Long text:** Speaker bios/voice styles are 100-200 words. Ensure full paste.
6. **Scripts vs prompts:** Always use files from `scripts/` (not `prompts/`) for the Text Idea field.
