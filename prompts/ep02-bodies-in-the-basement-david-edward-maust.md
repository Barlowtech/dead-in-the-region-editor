COLD OPEN (0:00–0:45):
Nate reads from an actual court document: 'The defendant has demonstrated a persistent and escalating pattern of predatory violence toward adolescent males. Recommendation: release with conditions.' Pause. Nate: 'They released him. He killed three more boys.' Carmen: '...I'm sorry what?'

THE CASE:
[Type: Real]

The real case of David Edward Maust — a serial killer who was released from prison MULTIPLE times despite a documented history of killing young men and burying them in basements. He killed at least five people across Indiana and other states. His final murders were in Michigan City IN in 2003 where he befriended and killed three teenage boys and buried them in his basement. The system failed catastrophically — he was a known killer who kept getting released. He eventually hanged himself in prison in 2006.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
A known serial killer was released from prison repeatedly and kept killing. The system had every reason to keep him locked up and didn't. The incompetence is staggering — and the victims paid for it.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Nate

Nate leads with methodical cinematic storytelling. Carmen's reactions are genuine and escalating — she starts with dark humor about the system's incompetence but gets progressively angrier as the scope of failure becomes clear. They agree on this one: the villain isn't just Maust it's the parole system. Carmen: 'So literally everyone whose job it was to keep this guy locked up just... didn't?' Nate: 'That's the story.' Carmen: 'THAT'S the story.'

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
Carmen makes a comment about how Nate's office wall of case files 'makes you look like a serial killer tracking serial killers' — callback to his wall of string-connected documents. Nate mentions he drives through Michigan City on his way to campus sometimes and it hits different now. Carmen asks if he's sleeping okay after this one. He deflects. She lets him.

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
Nate sourced this from court transcripts (Indiana DOC records) newspaper archives from the Michigan City News-Dispatch and the Post-Tribune and the actual parole board hearing documents he obtained through FOIA. He cross-referenced timelines against prison intake records. This is Nate at full research power.

---

TONAL MAP:
Starts measured and clinical (Nate establishing the facts) → builds outrage through Act 2 as the parole failures compound → genuine anger from both hosts by Act 3 → Outro is more subdued — they need to decompress after this one.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
The basement. The specificity of three boys buried under concrete. The fact that neighbors reported smells. The fact that Maust befriended his victims — the predatory patience of it. Nate describes Michigan City at night, the ordinariness of the apartment building. The horror is in the normalcy of the setting.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
Carmen's escalating disbelief at each parole decision ('They let him out AGAIN?!' — repeated with increasing volume each time). Dark humor aimed squarely at bureaucratic incompetence. Nate's deadpan reading of parole board language that sounds insane in context. Carmen: 'I want to speak to the manager of the Indiana prison system.'

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: Seed only. Nate mentions in passing that Maust's first Indiana victim (an earlier murder) was last seen near the industrial corridor on the Gary/East Chicago border. He doesn't connect it to the foundry explicitly. Just geography. Carmen doesn't notice.

SEASON ARC ROLE: Establish that the show covers real verifiable crimes with serious research. Demonstrate Nate's investigative rigor and citation practice. Show the audience what a 'Nate episode' feels like vs. the Carmen episode they just heard. Plant a geographic seed near the foundry.

CALLBACKS: None directly. But the tonal contrast with Episode 1 is itself a statement: last week was ambiguous and spooky this week is documented and horrifying.

---

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
Carmen: 'Next week I'm bringing one. And before you ask — no I did not get it from a court transcript. I got it from a much more reliable source.' Nate: 'Which is?' Carmen: 'Reddit.' Nate: [silence]

---

PRODUCTION NOTES:
This is the first 'Nate episode' so the audience is hearing his narration style for the first time at length. The prompt should emphasize his cinematic pacing and the contrast with Carmen's energy. Real case — all facts must be accurate and sourced.
