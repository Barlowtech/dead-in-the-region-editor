A voice whispering: 'Okay. I'm here. Building C. The door was already open.' Then Nate's voice breaking in: 'We need to talk about what you're about to hear.'

THE CASE:
[Type: Fictional]

Presented as a recovered audio recording. 'Tape 7' from an unlabeled box of cassettes found during the demolition of a building adjacent to the Meridian foundry in 2019. The episode IS the tape: an unidentified person recording their nighttime exploration of the foundry. Ambient sounds. Whispered narration. Unexplained noises — footsteps that don't match the explorer's machinery sounds when nothing should be running dripping water in areas with no plumbing. Dr. Vasquez provides brief contextual interstitials about the foundry's history between tape segments. Nate and Carmen bookend the episode only — they introduce the tape and react at the end. The tape cuts off mid-sentence.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
Someone walked into the Meridian foundry at night with a tape recorder. The tape documents what they found. The tape ends mid-sentence. We don't know who made it or what happened to them.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Neither (format-breaker)

MINIMAL HOST PRESENCE. Nate and Carmen bookend only — 3-4 minutes at the start 3-4 minutes at the end. The middle is the tape with Dr. Vasquez interstitials. In the bookends: both hosts are subdued. This tape rattled them. Carmen: 'I didn't sleep after I heard this.' Nate: 'Neither did I.' No bickering. No comedy. They're on the same side of whatever this is.

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
In the brief bookend segments the audience should feel that Nate and Carmen have been talking about this OFF MIC. There's a weight between them — they've been processing this together privately. Carmen: 'We almost didn't air this.' Nate: 'We talked about it.' Carmen: 'A lot.' This implies a relationship deeper than what the audience usually sees.

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
The tape was found by a demolition crew and entered into an evidence log that went nowhere. Carmen obtained a digital copy through 'a friend of a friend who works for the demo company' (classic Carmen sourcing). The tape itself is unverified. Dr. Vasquez authenticated the foundry details described on the tape — the layout matches historical records.

---

TONAL MAP:
Dread from the first second. No warmth. No comfort. No humor. Pure slow-building atmospheric horror. This is the scariest thing the show has ever done. The silence at the end should feel like a void.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
The content of the tape as described by the hosts. The explorer narrates what they see inside the foundry — the scale of it, the decay, the wrongness. They describe hearing what sounds like machinery that shouldn't be running. A door they didn't close. Their narration becomes increasingly panicked. Nate reads the transcript of the tape's final moments — and it just stops mid-word. The hosts sit with that silence.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
None. This episode has zero comedy. The absence of humor IS the statement.

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: CENTRAL. The entire episode takes place at/about the Meridian foundry. Dr. Vasquez provides historical context: when it was built who owned it what it produced the environmental violations the labor disputes the mysterious fire in 1989 that destroyed records.

SEASON ARC ROLE: Format-breaking episode that resets audience expectations. Pure atmosphere and horror. The foundry becomes a CHARACTER through audio. This is the episode that proves the show can be genuinely frightening — no comedy safety net.

CALLBACKS: The tape connects to the Whiting Recordings (Eps 4-5) — similar cassette format similar sense of someone documenting something they shouldn't be. The foundry details match what Nate has mentioned in Eps 1 3 5 and 7. Dr. Vasquez's history fills in gaps.

---

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
No traditional tease. The episode ends with the tape cutting out. Then Nate's voice: 'We'll be back next week. We have a lot to talk about.' Silence. Credits.

---

PRODUCTION NOTES:
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCTION from every other episode. Since Speechify generates dialogue only (no ambient sound or SFX), the 'found tape' content should be delivered as the hosts READING or DESCRIBING the tape transcript rather than playing it. Frame it as: Nate and Carmen have a transcript of the tape and are walking the listener through it, with Dr. Vasquez providing historical context between sections. The horror comes from their descriptions and reactions, not from the tape audio itself.
