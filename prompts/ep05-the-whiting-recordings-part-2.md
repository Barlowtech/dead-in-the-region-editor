COLD OPEN (0:00–0:45):
Carmen's voice: 'Last week I told you I didn't like this one. I still don't.' Then Nate: 'I spent the last week looking into the address Carmen found. I wish I hadn't.' Carmen reads from the next tape entry: 'The van came back. Same time. I watched it from the window. Someone got out this time.'

THE CASE:
[Type: Fictional]

Carmen finishes the tape story. She reveals what she's found about the woman on the recordings — pieced together from the Whiting Historical Society (Nate helped with this part) neighborhood interviews and more Reddit deep dives. The woman's name was (fictional) Elena Varga — second-generation Hungarian-American who worked at a pharmacy on Indianapolis Blvd. She reported the van to Whiting PD twice; both reports were filed and ignored. She stopped showing up to work in February 2004. No missing persons report was ever filed. No investigation. She simply stopped existing in the record. The van was registered to a company that traces back to a shell corp with an address at the Meridian foundry.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
A woman reported her own stalking to police twice. They did nothing. She disappeared. No one filed a missing persons report. She simply fell through every crack in the system.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Carmen

The dynamic shifts again. Now they're collaborating — Carmen's street-level sourcing and Nate's archival skills working together for the first time. This is the episode where the audience sees them as a real team not just two people talking past each other. The resolution is unsettling and ambiguous — they disagree about what happened to Elena (Carmen thinks the worst; Nate wants to believe there's another explanation) and for once the disagreement doesn't feel like banter. It feels like two people processing something awful.

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
After the heavy resolution there should be a moment in the outro where Carmen thanks Nate — sincerely not as a bit — for helping her with the research. He says 'That's what this is.' She says 'Yeah.' A beat of genuine warmth between them that the audience hasn't seen before. It's brief. Then she makes a joke and it's over. But it happened.

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
Same sourcing chain as Part 1 but now Nate has contributed research — he contacted the Whiting Historical Society and pulled property records for the condemned house and the van's registration. Carmen: 'See this is why we work. I find the weird stuff and you make it real.' Nate: 'I'm not sure real is the word I'd use.'

---

TONAL MAP:
Starts tense (picking up from the cliffhanger) → methodical investigation energy through Act 1 → devastating reveal in Act 2 about Elena's disappearance → quiet reflective Act 3 as they process → Outro is warmer than expected. The hosts need each other after this one.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
Carmen relaying the woman's increasingly afraid tape entries. The specificity of the van's schedule — someone was watching her on a PATTERN. The shell corporation. The empty lot where the house used to be. Carmen describes visiting the location: 'There's nothing here now. But there was something here.' The fact that NO ONE reported the woman missing.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
Minimal. A few pressure-release moments: Nate correcting Carmen's pronunciation of a street name ('It's Indianapolis Boulevard not Indianapolis BLVD' / 'That's literally the same thing'). Carmen's brief callback to her tía Gloria: 'My tía says she remembers the Vargas. She says they kept to themselves.' The humor is gentle not dark.

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: DIRECT AND EXPLICIT. The van's registration traces to a shell company with an address at the Meridian foundry. Carmen: 'Okay so the foundry thing — that's three times now.' Nate: 'I know. I've been looking into it.' The season arc is now visible to the audience.

SEASON ARC ROLE: The walls between 'Carmen's fictional world' and 'Nate's researched world' break down. The foundry becomes the meeting point. The season arc announces itself. The show's thesis becomes clear: some things fall through the cracks on purpose.

CALLBACKS: Direct sequel to Ep 4. Carmen references Nate's foundry mentions from Eps 1 and 3. The shell corporation discovery is the first time the foundry shifts from background detail to active plot element.

---

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
Nate: 'I've been spending some time looking into the Meridian foundry. Not for the show — just for me. I'll let you know what I find.' Carmen: 'You're scaring me professor.' Nate: 'Good. You should be paying attention.'

PRODUCTION NOTES:
This resolution needs to feel EARNED. The audience waited a week for this. Don't rush the revelation about Elena. Let it build. The emotional weight should come from the systemic failure not the horror — a woman asked for help and nobody helped. That's the real horror.
