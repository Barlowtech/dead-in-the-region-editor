---

COLD OPEN (0:00–0:45):
Nate's voice: 'I need to tell you something. I should have said this weeks ago.' Carmen: 'Nate, you're freaking me out.' Nate: 'Good. Because I've been freaking out for about three weeks now. Every case we've covered this season — the Borman Lights, the Whiting tapes, the Lake Effect, that foundry recording — they're all connected. And I can prove it.'

THE CASE:
[Type: Fictional]

Nate has been quietly investigating the Meridian foundry for weeks — off mic between episodes. He lays out EVERYTHING: the connections across Episodes 1 3 4 5 7 and 8. The witness near the foundry in the Borman Lights case. Peterson's associate. The shell company from the Whiting recordings. The erased worker from the Lake Effect. The tape. He's mapped it on a timeline and the pattern is undeniable: for decades people have been disappearing in the orbit of this building. Carmen starts the episode joking but grows increasingly serious as the scope becomes clear. Part 1 ends with Nate revealing that someone has been leaving him messages — physical notes on his car at Purdue — from someone who knows he's been looking into the foundry.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
Every case this season connects to one building. It's not a coincidence. And someone knows Nate has figured it out.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Both

This is the collaboration episode. They're not alternating — they're working together building the case in real time on mic. Carmen drops the comedy earlier than any previous episode. By the midpoint she's doing something she's never done on the show: she's scared. Not horror-movie scared. Really scared. For Nate. The notes on his car mean someone is watching. Carmen: 'You need to stop.' Nate: 'I can't.' Carmen: 'Nate.' Nate: 'I found something.' Carmen: 'I know. That's why you need to stop.'

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
The notes on Nate's car bring the danger into their real lives for the first time. Carmen's fear for Nate is personal — not performer fear but friend fear. There should be a moment where she says something like 'I'm not doing this show if something happens to you' and she means it. The audience should feel the relationship underneath the podcast — these are real people who care about each other and the situation has escalated beyond entertainment.

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
Nate has compiled his own research — his wall of string-connected documents is now specifically about the foundry. He's pulled property records corporate filings environmental reports EPA violation records and historical employment data. Carmen brought what she has too — the Reddit threads the community knowledge the Whiting tapes. For the first time their sources MERGE.

---

TONAL MAP:
Starts with false normalcy that drains within minutes → methodical investigation building → growing dread as connections accumulate → genuine fear when the notes are revealed → Cliffhanger ending.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
The scope. The timeline. Seeing all the connections laid out at once and understanding that this has been happening for DECADES. The notes on Nate's car — someone is watching. The foundry as a nexus of disappearance. The institutional machinery that kept it invisible. And underneath it all: the knowledge that both hosts are now personally involved in something they started as entertainment.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
Almost none. Carmen makes one early joke ('So I'm guessing this isn't a fun one') that gets a flat 'No' from Nate. That's it. The absence of humor from Carmen — the loudest funniest person in the room going quiet — should unsettle the audience more than any sound effect.

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: CENTRAL. This is the foundry's episode. Everything converges.

SEASON ARC ROLE: The season's central mystery begins in earnest. All previous episodes get recontextualized. The hosts are no longer just telling stories — they're IN one. The power dynamic between hosts and material shifts.

CALLBACKS: Every episode from 1-8 is referenced explicitly. This is the 'Previously On' episode — the audience needs to see all the threads at once.

---

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
Nate: 'Someone wants me to find something at the foundry. Next week... I think I'm going to find it.' Carmen: 'We. WE are going to find it.' End.

---

PRODUCTION NOTES:
The recap of all previous episodes needs to feel like revelation not summary. The audience should be going 'oh my god' as they see the connections. The notes on Nate's car escalate from investigation to thriller. This episode changes what the show IS.
