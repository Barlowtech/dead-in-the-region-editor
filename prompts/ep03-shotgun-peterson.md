COLD OPEN (0:00–0:45):
Carmen's voice: 'So this is gonna be one of those episodes where I'm laughing and then I feel bad about laughing and then I'm laughing again.' Nate: 'That is exactly what this episode is.'

THE CASE:
[Type: Real]

The real case of a violent crime spree in NWI involving a suspect known as 'Shotgun Peterson.' A chaotic brutal series of events marked by staggering criminal incompetence and equally staggering system failures. The case lets Carmen's comedian side loose — the criminal's decision-making is so bad it's almost comedic — while Nate keeps grounding it in the real cost to real people.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
The criminal incompetence is so extreme it circles back around to being terrifying — because this person was still able to hurt people despite being catastrophically bad at crime.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Nate

Nate tells the story but keeps pausing to let Carmen react because her reactions are the episode. She goes on extended riffs about the suspect's terrible decision-making — full impersonation mode — while Nate waits with visible patience. They genuinely disagree about whether to feel sorry for the suspect (Carmen: no. Nate: slightly yes because of the systemic factors). Carmen: 'Stop trying to make me feel empathy for shotgun man.'

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
Carmen mentions that her tía Gloria actually remembers when this happened and had opinions about it — first reference to her family's deep roots in the community as a source of knowledge. Nate admits he hadn't heard of this case until six months into living in NWI which Carmen finds hilarious: 'You lived HERE and didn't know about SHOTGUN PETERSON?'

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
Nate sourced from local police records Post-Tribune archives and trial transcripts. He also found a local TV news segment from the era. Full Nate-level citations throughout.

TONAL MAP:
Starts light and comedic → stays mostly funny through Act 1 and early Act 2 → takes a hard turn when the real violence hits → recovers with humor in the outro but the audience has felt the whiplash.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
The real human cost beneath the comedy — Nate makes sure the victims aren't forgotten. He grounds each comedic beat with the specific NWI geography of the crimes. The moment when the comedy drops and the violence is just violence.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
Carmen does a full extended riff on the criminal's series of terrible decisions — voices included. She riffs on the getaway route ('He went THAT way? On THAT road? At THAT time?'). Nate's dry footnotes to Carmen's comedy ('To be fair the road was under construction' / 'That detail isn't confirmed'). Carmen impersonating a local news anchor delivering the story.

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: While researching Nate found that one of Peterson's known associates worked at the Meridian foundry in the 1980s. He mentions it as a footnote. Carmen catches it: 'Why does that place keep coming up?' Nate plays it cool but he's noticed too.

SEASON ARC ROLE: Deepen NWI atmosphere. First DELIBERATE connection between a real case and the foundry. Show the comedy/tragedy balance. Establish that Carmen can be the funniest thing in the episode even when she's not the storyteller.

CALLBACKS: Carmen references 'the Borman Lights guy' from Episode 1 when discussing NWI geography — first cross-episode callback. The tonal range contrast with Episode 2 shows the audience the show can be different things.

---

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
Nate: 'Carmen has something for next week. She's been texting me about it at 2 AM.' Carmen: 'It's a two-parter.' Nate: 'She's never done a two-parter.' Carmen: 'I found tapes.'

PRODUCTION NOTES:
Balance episode — needs to be the funniest episode so far while also earning its dramatic moments. The comedy should make the horror hit harder not softer. This is the episode that proves the show can be both things at once.
