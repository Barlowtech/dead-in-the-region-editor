COLD OPEN (0:00–0:45):
A woman's voice, slightly muffled as if recorded on old equipment: 'November 3rd. I'm recording this because I don't think anyone is going to believe me if I just tell them.' Carmen's voice: 'I found these. Or — someone sent them to me. It's complicated.'

THE CASE:
[Type: Fictional]

In 2003 a collection of cassette tapes was allegedly found in a condemned house in Whiting Indiana during demolition. The recordings contain a woman's voice — no name given — documenting increasingly strange occurrences in her neighborhood over several months. Sounds at night that don't match traffic or industry. People walking the block who don't belong and don't respond when spoken to. A white van that circles the neighborhood on a pattern — always between 2 and 4 AM. The woman sounds increasingly afraid. The tapes end abruptly mid-sentence on what would be Tape 6.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
A woman documents her own disappearance in real time without knowing that's what she's doing. The tapes are her voice getting progressively more scared until it just stops.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Carmen

CRITICAL DYNAMIC SHIFT: This is the first time Carmen tells a story that genuinely scares her. She starts with her usual energy — 'okay so this is going to sound insane' — but her tone changes as she plays the recordings. She gets quieter. Nate notices. He shifts from skeptic to concerned — not about the case but about Carmen. He starts asking more careful questions. By the end Carmen is rattled and Nate is the one cracking a small joke to break tension (role reversal). Carmen: 'I don't like this one.' Nate: 'You brought it.' Carmen: 'I KNOW.'

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
This should be the first episode where their dating history comes up as a punchline. Early in the episode during light banter before the tapes: Carmen mentions being at Nate's apartment and seeing his research wall and Nate says something like 'You used to live there.' Carmen: 'We were nineteen. Moving on.' This establishes the backstory for new listeners without making it a big deal. Also: Carmen mentions her job in passing and immediately shuts it down — 'I don't want to talk about Merrillville.'

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
Carmen says a listener DM'd her a link to a Craigslist post (now deleted) from someone in Whiting selling 'a box of weird tapes found during renovation.' The Craigslist poster claimed to have listened to the first two and gotten too creeped out to continue. Carmen tracked down the poster through Reddit — 'and before you say anything Nate I KNOW' — and got digital copies of the recordings. The chain of custody is terrible. The sourcing is a mess. The tapes are terrifying.

---

TONAL MAP:
Starts normal/light Carmen energy → creeping unease through Act 1 → genuine tension in Act 2 → by Act 3 the humor is gone and both hosts are unsettled → Cliffhanger ending with no resolution.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
The content of the tapes — Carmen reads or paraphrases the woman's increasingly frightened entries. The specificity: she names the intersection, she names the van's schedule, she describes a figure standing across the street 'just standing there looking at the house.' The way the final tape cuts off mid-sentence. Carmen's voice changes as she relays each recording — she gets quieter.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
Front-loaded. The humor lives in the first 8 minutes — Carmen's setup of how she found the tapes is classic Carmen (the Craigslist rabbit hole / Nate's exasperation at the sourcing / Carmen defending 'Reddit forensics'). Humor drains out as the tapes play. A brief pressure-release joke from Nate in the middle of Act 2 ('This is the most organized thing you've ever done'). By Act 3 the humor is gone.

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: REVEALED. Part 1 ends with Nate cross-referencing the condemned house's address with his own research. The house was three blocks from the Meridian foundry. Carmen: 'Wait.' Nate: 'Yeah.' Carmen: 'Nate.' Nate: 'I know.' CLIFFHANGER. End of episode.

SEASON ARC ROLE: First multi-episode arc. First time the foundry becomes impossible to ignore. First time Carmen's story connects to Nate's research. The walls between their storytelling domains start to blur.

CALLBACKS: Carmen references Ep 1 ('This is giving me Borman Lights energy'). Nate mentally connecting the foundry mentions from Eps 1 and 3 — he's been keeping a list.

---

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
No traditional tease — the cliffhanger IS the tease. The episode ends on the foundry revelation. Dead air. Then theme music. Maybe Carmen's voice under the credits: 'Part two next week. I need to talk to Nate about something first.'

---

PRODUCTION NOTES:
This is the episode where the show levels up. The audience came for banter and true crime; this is where they realize the show is doing something bigger. Carmen's tonal shift from comedian to genuinely scared storyteller needs to feel earned not forced. The cliffhanger should feel inevitable not cheap.
