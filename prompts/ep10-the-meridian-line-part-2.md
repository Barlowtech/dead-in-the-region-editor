COLD OPEN (0:00–0:45):
Dr. Vasquez's voice reading from a historical record: 'Meridian Steel Company — incorporated 1923. Principal shareholders...' She pauses. 'I probably shouldn't say these names on air.' Nate: 'Say them.' A beat. She does.

THE CASE:
[Type: Mixed (real case recontextualized)]

Nate revisits a real case covered earlier in the season (Maust or Peterson — whichever works better) with new FICTIONAL information that connects it to the foundry. Dr. Vasquez provides historical context about the foundry's owners: the Meridian Steel Company its political connections its history of environmental violations and the 1989 fire that destroyed employment records. The episode asks the central question: what happened at the foundry that nobody investigated because the people involved — immigrants night-shift workers people without connections — didn't matter to the people in charge? Carmen is angry. Not comedian-angry. Actually angry. This is the most emotionally intense episode of the season.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
The foundry wasn't just a building where bad things happened. It was a machine for making people invisible. And the people who ran it had the connections to keep it that way.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Nate

Dr. Vasquez anchors this episode. She's not the quirky guest from Ep 6 — she's a historian delivering testimony. Nate defers to her expertise. Carmen is the audience surrogate but angrier than the audience — this is HER community that was victimized. The dynamic shifts to Carmen as moral center: she's not cracking jokes because this isn't funny. She's asking 'why didn't anyone care?' and the answer is the horror.

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
Carmen connects the foundry's workers to her own family. Her grandparents worked in the mills. The people who disappeared from the foundry's orbit were people like her family. This is personal for her in a way it can't be for Nate and she says so: 'You can research this and go home. I AM home. These are my people.' Nate doesn't argue. He knows she's right. It's the most honest moment in the series.

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
Nate's research plus Dr. Vasquez's academic and archival work. Property records corporate filings EPA violation history political donation records. This is the most heavily cited episode of the season — every claim is sourced. Carmen contributes community knowledge: families who worked at the foundry. 'My abuela's neighbor — his son worked there in the 70s. He doesn't talk about it.'

---

TONAL MAP:
Pure intensity. Starts heavy and gets heavier. No comic relief. No lighter moments. The anger and sadness should be sustained for 25+ minutes. This is the episode that earns every lighter moment the show has ever had.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
Institutional horror. The foundry's corporate owners had connections to local government. EPA violations were filed and shelved. The 1989 fire — was it accidental? Employment records destroyed. The workers who disappeared were undocumented or transient or simply people nobody was tracking. The system didn't fail. The system worked exactly as designed — for certain people.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
None. Zero humor. The absence should feel heavy and intentional. If anything Nate might attempt his usual dry aside at one point and Carmen doesn't respond to it — she's past that. He reads the room and stops.

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: CENTRAL. The foundry's full history is laid out. The institutional machinery of erasure is documented. The political connections are named.

SEASON ARC ROLE: A real case gets reframed through the foundry connection. The show's thesis is delivered explicitly through Carmen's anger and Dr. Vasquez's scholarship. This is the emotional climax of the season.

CALLBACKS: Direct continuation of Ep 9. Recontextualizes Eps 2 or 3. Dr. Vasquez's comments from Ep 6 about immigrant workers become prophetic.

---

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
Carmen: 'Tomorrow night. The foundry. We're going.' Nate: 'Carmen—' Carmen: 'Don't. We're going.'

---

PRODUCTION NOTES:
The most emotionally demanding episode. Carmen's anger needs to feel real — not performed righteous rage but the specific anger of someone whose community was targeted. Dr. Vasquez provides the evidence. Nate provides the structure. Carmen provides the soul.
