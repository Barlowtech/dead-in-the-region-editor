---

COLD OPEN (0:00–0:45):
Carmen's voice, warm and relaxed: 'So. Season One.' Nate: 'Season One.' Carmen: 'We made it.' Nate: 'Barely.' Carmen laughs — a real laugh. It's the best moment of the whole series.

THE CASE:
[Type: Mixed]

Nate and Carmen reflect on the season. They revisit key moments. They acknowledge what they got right and wrong. They talk about what it was like to investigate stories that blur the line between real and invented — and whether that line matters as much as they thought it did. Dr. Vasquez joins for a segment on the Region's future — not just its past. The episode is warmer and more personal than anything else in the season. The hosts let their guard down. Carmen talks about what the podcast has meant to her. Nate talks about what NWI has become to him. Then: the final two minutes. A 'post-credits' audio clip. A new message. The foundry story isn't over. Nate: 'We got another message.' Silence. End of season.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
After everything — is the act of telling these stories enough? And: it's not over.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Both

Warmest dynamic of the season. The bickering is back but it's affectionate — the tension of Eps 9-11 has released. They're comfortable again. They tease each other. Carmen's comedy returns. Nate's dry humor resurfaces. They sound like two people who went through something together and came out the other side closer. Dr. Vasquez provides the grownup perspective — she's been through versions of this before. She grounds them.

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
MOST PERSONAL EPISODE. Carmen says the podcast saved her — not dramatically but honestly. She was drowning in a corporate job in a town she'd left and come back to for the wrong reasons and the show gave her a reason to care about the Region again instead of resenting it. Nate says he came to NWI as a researcher and the podcast made him a resident. 'I live here now. Not just geographically.' The dating-history joke should make its final appearance: Carmen: 'And to think — if we hadn't broken up we never would have been good enough friends for this.' Nate: 'That's... actually the nicest thing you've ever said to me.' Carmen: 'Don't get used to it.'

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
No case research this episode. They're reflecting not investigating. The 'sources' are their own experiences and each other. Dr. Vasquez brings perspective on the Region's trajectory — academic but personal.

---

TONAL MAP:
Warm warm warm warm warm → post-credits COLD. The contrast is the point. The warmth makes the final chill devastating. The audience should feel safe and then suddenly not.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
Minimal — this is a warm episode. The only horror is in the post-credits tease: the implication that the foundry story continues. A new message. An unknown sender. Nate's voice after everything seems wrapped up: 'We got another message.' The season ends on a whisper of dread after 25 minutes of warmth.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
Comedy returns. Carmen roasts Nate's research wall. Nate roasts Carmen's Reddit sourcing. They do a 'highlight reel' of their best arguments from the season. Carmen does an impression of Nate reading court documents. Nate does a terrible impression of Carmen gasping. Dr. Vasquez: 'You're both ridiculous and I'm honored to know you.' Carmen: 'See THAT'S how you give a compliment professor.'

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: Discussed explicitly. They talk about the foundry openly — what they found what it means what they still don't know. The post-credits tease implies Season 2 will go deeper.

SEASON ARC ROLE: Season wrap. Emotional payoff for the host relationship arc. Setup for Season 2. The post-credits tease should feel like a cold hand on the back of your neck after 25 minutes of sitting by a fire.

CALLBACKS: The entire season. Specific callbacks to favorite moments arguments and discoveries. The dating-history joke gets its final and best iteration.

---

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
Nate (after credits appear to be rolling): 'We got another message.' Long silence. Carmen doesn't speak. Wind. End.

---

PRODUCTION NOTES:
The post-credits tease is the most important 30 seconds of the season. Everything before it is earned — let the hosts be human and funny and warm. Then pull the rug. The message implies Season 2. Leave EVERYTHING about it ambiguous.
