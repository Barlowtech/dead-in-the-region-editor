COLD OPEN (0:00–0:45):
Nate's voice: 'On June 14th 1985 two people disappeared from the same half-mile of beach. Only one of them got a police report. I want to tell you about the other one.'

THE CASE:
[Type: Mixed (real framework + fictional case)]

Nate investigates an unsolved real disappearance from the Indiana Dunes in the 1980s — a young man who went to the beach with friends and never came back. Sparse records minimal investigation. The case was attributed to drowning but no body was ever recovered. While digging into the archives Nate discovers something the original investigators missed (fictional): records suggesting a SECOND person disappeared from the same stretch of beach on the same weekend. This person — a foundry night-shift worker — was never reported missing because he had no family in the area and his employer (the Meridian foundry) simply removed his name from the payroll.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
Two people vanish from the same beach on the same weekend. One gets a police report. One gets erased from a payroll. The difference is who was looking for them.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Nate

This is where the real/fictional line blurs ON PURPOSE for the first time. Nate presents both disappearances with equal rigor — same tone same level of detail same citation style. Carmen can't tell which is real and which isn't (and neither can the audience). She asks 'Is this real?' at one point and Nate says 'Does it matter? This is what happens to people nobody's looking for.' It's the thesis statement of the show.

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
Carmen is quieter in this episode — still herself but the Whiting episodes changed something. She's taking the stories more personally. At one point she mentions her grandfather coming to NWI for mill work and says 'He could have been that guy. If things had gone different he could have been the name crossed off a list.' Nate doesn't respond right away. He knows this hit close to home.

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
Nate's real case is sourced from original police records and newspaper archives. The fictional second disappearance is 'discovered' through foundry employment records he obtained from a historical archive — a payroll ledger showing a name crossed out with no termination date and no forwarding address. Carmen is disturbed by how easy it was to erase someone.

---

TONAL MAP:
Somber and atmospheric throughout. The lightest moment is the first 5 minutes. The rest is a slow descent into the horror of institutional erasure. Ends heavy.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
Nate describes Lake Michigan at night — the undertow, the cold, the darkness. The specific feel of the Dunes at night — industrial on one side, wilderness on the other. The payroll ledger with a name erased. The idea that someone can work and live in a community and when they vanish the only record is a pencil line through their name.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
Less comedy than usual. Carmen's humor is present but subdued — more wry observations than full riffs. A dark-humor moment about the foundry's HR practices ('So their offboarding process was just... a pencil eraser?'). Nate appreciates the joke more than usual because they both need it.

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: DIRECT. The fictional victim worked night shifts at the Meridian foundry. The foundry erased his records. Carmen: 'That place is like a black hole. Things go in and don't come out.' Nate doesn't disagree.

SEASON ARC ROLE: The line between real and fictional blurs explicitly. The show's central question crystallizes: who gets remembered and who gets erased? The foundry shifts from setting to actor — it's doing things now not just existing.

CALLBACKS: Carmen references her tía Gloria and her family's mill history. The 'invisible victims' theme connects to Dr. Vasquez's comments in Ep 6. The foundry is now a pattern both hosts acknowledge.

---

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
Nate: 'Someone sent me something about the foundry. A recording. I haven't listened to it yet.' Carmen: 'What kind of recording?' Nate: 'I don't know. That's what scares me.'

---

PRODUCTION NOTES:
This is a pivotal episode — the one where the show's thesis becomes text instead of subtext. The prompt needs to nail the dual-disappearance structure and make the fictional case feel as real as the real one. Nate's narration should be at its most cinematic.
