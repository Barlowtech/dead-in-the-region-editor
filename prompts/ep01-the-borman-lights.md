PODCAST: Dead in the Region — Episode 1: "The Borman Lights"
FORMAT: Standalone
TYPE: Fictional (presented ambiguously)
HOSTS: Nate Alderman (narrator/researcher) and Carmen Reyes (reactor/comedian)
SPEAKERS: 2

COLD OPEN (0:00–0:45):
Sound of highway traffic at night — semis passing — then silence between trucks. Carmen's voice: 'His car was still running. Door open. Radio on. And that's it. That's all there was.' Nate: 'That can't be all there was.' Carmen: 'That's what I said.'

THE CASE:
[Type: Fictional (presented ambiguously)]

In 1997 multiple drivers on the Borman Expressway reported strange lights in the industrial corridor between Gary and Hammond. Two cars pulled over on the shoulder. One driver was never seen again. The case was written off as a prank by Hammond PD but Carmen has pulled together Reddit posts and community accounts that don't match the official story. The missing driver — a second-shift steelworker named Miguel Oros — left behind a car with the engine still running and the radio tuned to static.

CASE HOOK (the single most compelling detail):
A man pulls over to look at lights on the Borman and simply ceases to exist. His car was found running with the door open. No footprints leading away from the vehicle.

HOST DYNAMICS FOR THIS EPISODE:
PRIMARY STORYTELLER: Carmen

Carmen tells the story with oral-tradition energy — digressions and backtracking included. Nate keeps interrupting to ask for sourcing ('Who told you this?' 'A guy at a shop.' 'Which shop?' 'Does it matter?' 'YES.'). They disagree about whether the lights were industrial or something else entirely. Nate thinks there's a mundane explanation; Carmen thinks the mundane explanation is too convenient.

PERSONAL MOMENTS (non-case interactions):
This is Episode 1 — the audience is meeting these two for the first time. Work in how they know each other naturally: Carmen mentions 'when you first moved here' and Nate references 'back when we were at IU.' Don't over-explain the relationship — let it emerge. Carmen ribs him about how long it took him to learn which highways go where. Nate admits he still uses GPS for the Borman interchange.

SOURCE ATTRIBUTION:
Carmen sourced this from a 2016 Reddit thread on r/UnresolvedMysteries (since deleted) cross-referenced with posts from a local Facebook group called 'NWI After Dark.' She also talked to a guy at her cousin's shop who claims he was driving the Borman that night. Nate is skeptical of every single source.

TONAL MAP:
Starts casual and playful (hosts establishing rapport) → builds curiosity through Act 1 → tension increases in Act 2 as details accumulate → Act 3 delivers the gut-level creepiness of the open car → Outro is lighter as hosts process and banter.

---

HORROR/ATMOSPHERE BEATS:
The silence between passing trucks on the Borman at 2 AM. The image of a car running with the door open and no one around. The radio tuned to static. The industrial corridor at night — refineries burning off gas creating orange light against low clouds. Carmen describes the stretch of highway where it happened and it sounds like a liminal space.

---

DARK HUMOR BEATS:
Carmen does an impression of the guy at her cousin's shop telling the story. She narrates the police report in a mock-serious newscaster voice. Nate's dry observation that 'the Borman Expressway is already terrifying without mysterious lights' gets a big laugh from Carmen.

---

SERIALIZATION NOTES:
FOUNDRY CONNECTION: Background only. One witness mentioned seeing lights 'near the old Meridian foundry.' Nate notes this as interesting but doesn't pursue it. Plant the seed — don't water it.

SEASON ARC ROLE: Establish hosts and their dynamic. Establish format: real geography + ambiguous events + hosts who disagree. Establish the alternating-storyteller model and the source-quality gap. Plant the first foundry seed so subtly that first-time listeners won't notice.

CALLBACKS: None — this is the pilot.

NEXT EPISODE TEASE:
Nate: 'Carmen found something else this week. I haven't heard it yet. She says it's worse. She says that a lot.'

---

PRODUCTION NOTES:
First episode — everything is being established. The prompt needs to do heavy lifting on making the hosts feel like real people the audience wants to spend time with. Prioritize chemistry over case complexity. The case should be engaging but the hosts are the real hook.
