# Speechify Studio Workflow — Dead in the Region

How the script and companion data fit together in Speechify Studio's podcast creation wizard.

## Overview

The production workflow has two parallel tracks:

1. **The Script** (generated by this skill) → goes into Speechify's "Text Idea" field
2. **The Configuration** (speaker profiles + audience data) → goes into Speechify's setup fields

Both are needed. The script tells Speechify WHAT to say. The configuration tells Speechify
HOW to say it (voice character, audience awareness, tonal calibration).

## Step-by-Step Speechify Process

### Pre-Creation Dialog

1. Navigate to Speechify Studio → Library
2. Click **"Create a Podcast (Beta)"**
3. In the dialog:
   - Select the **"Text Idea"** tab
   - Paste the ENTIRE script file (from `scripts/ep##-title.md`) into the text field
   - Set **Language** to "English (US)"
   - Set **Number of Speakers** to 2 (or 3 for episodes with Dr. Vasquez: Eps 6, 8, 10, 12)
   - Set **Duration** to "20-30min"
4. Click **"Create"**

### Step 1: Review Source Content

Speechify generates a research document from the script. This is where the narrative-forward
approach pays off — Speechify should produce something that reads like a story outline, not
a list of facts.

Review checklist:
- Does the cold open hook appear early?
- Is the three-act structure visible?
- Are host dynamics and tonal shifts reflected?
- Are NWI geography details present?

If it drifted back toward "news report" mode, use the chat refinement to redirect:
"This should read as a narrative story told between two friends, not a news report.
Focus on the conversational dynamic and emotional arc."

### Step 2: Audience & Mood

Speechify generates audience targeting. **Replace all fields** with the templates from
`data/audience.json`:

| Speechify Field | Source |
|---|---|
| Primary Audience | `audience.json` → `primary_audience` |
| Geography & Background | `audience.json` → `geography_background` |
| Values & Interests | `audience.json` → `values_interests` |
| Mood | `audience.json` → `mood` |
| Tone | `audience.json` → `tone` |

**Episode-specific overrides** (adjust the pasted text):
- **Episode 8** (Tape 7): Adjust Mood to emphasize found-footage atmosphere, remove humor references
- **Episode 11** (Meridian Line Pt 3): Adjust Mood to emphasize building dread and emotional intensity
- **Episode 12** (Signal and Noise): Adjust Tone to note warmer, more reflective register

### Step 3: Speaker Profiles

Speechify generates speaker names/bios/voices. **Replace all fields** with profiles from
`data/speakers.json`:

**For 2-speaker episodes (standard):**

| Speechify Field | Source |
|---|---|
| Speaker 1 (Host) → Name | "Nate Alderman" |
| Speaker 1 (Host) → Biography | `speakers.json` → speakers[0].biography |
| Speaker 1 (Host) → Voice Style | `speakers.json` → speakers[0].voice_style |
| Speaker 2 (Guest) → Name | "Carmen Reyes" |
| Speaker 2 (Guest) → Biography | `speakers.json` → speakers[1].biography |
| Speaker 2 (Guest) → Voice Style | `speakers.json` → speakers[1].voice_style |

**For 3-speaker episodes (Eps 6, 8, 10, 12):**
Add a third speaker:

| Speechify Field | Source |
|---|---|
| Speaker 3 (Guest 2) → Name | "Dr. Mara Vasquez" |
| Speaker 3 (Guest 2) → Biography | `speakers.json` → speakers[2].biography |
| Speaker 3 (Guest 2) → Voice Style | `speakers.json` → speakers[2].voice_style |

**Episode-specific speaker notes:**
- **Episode 8**: Consider adding "In this episode, Nate and Carmen are subdued and serious —
  no comedy, no banter in the main section" to both hosts' Voice Style fields
- **Episode 4-5**: Consider adding "Carmen becomes progressively more unsettled as the episode
  continues" to Carmen's Voice Style

### Step 4: Review Generated Script

Speechify produces the full dialogue from your script input. Review:
- [ ] Cold open hooks immediately
- [ ] Host voices are distinct (Nate measured, Carmen energetic)
- [ ] Comedy/horror balance follows the tonal arc
- [ ] Act structure is clear
- [ ] Foundry/serialization elements present where expected
- [ ] Episode ends with the tease or cliffhanger
- [ ] The overall feel is "story" not "report"

Use chat refinement for targeted fixes. Edit directly for small changes.

### Step 5: Generate & Export

Click through to generate audio. When complete:
- Spot-check: cold open, one mid-episode section, and the outro
- Verify host voices sound distinct
- Check that tonal shifts land audibly
- Export via the Export button (outputs .wav)

## Browser Automation Notes

When automating Speechify via Claude Cowork's browser tools:

1. **Pasting text**: Click into textarea → Select all (Ctrl+A) → Paste (Ctrl+V)
2. **Wait for validation**: Some fields auto-save — wait 1-2 seconds between fields
3. **Navigation**: "Next step" buttons move through the wizard sequentially
4. **Field detection**: Use accessibility tree or `find` tool to locate fields by label
5. **Long text**: Speaker bios/voice styles are 100-200 words. Ensure full paste.
